# Introduction

pag 73 GDL - why DA is su-optimzal and a better choise is to consider architectures with richer invariant groups

space is a set Ω equipped a translated filter is matched with the signal, the idea of group convolution
with a transitive group action,
meaning that for any u, v ∈ Ω is to move the filter around the domain using the group action, e.g.
